<h2>How to see and understand incoming tickets</h2>

<p>
Here we are logged in as Agent Jim. Under the Ticket tab, we can see all open un-assigned tickets that are coming in. Here we can see 4 different tickets have arrived. We can see the Subject of the ticket (Title) but to see more info we will have to click onto the ticket to see more details and to assign people to it.

<h2>Set SLA to the ticket and assign an Agent</h2>

<p>
Here we can see i have assigned myself (Jim) and set the SLA to "SEV-A" which means it must be resolved within 1hour, as this is the boss`s computer and is business critical. We can reply directly to the submitter right in the ticket and they would recive a notification in their email that they got a resons and we could start a dialogue right in the ticket, aswell as if multiple agents is working and want to post updates but not to the end user you can use the "Post Internal Notes" tab to write notes that only Agents can access.
